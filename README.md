## Socio-Economic and Academic Relationship Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between students’ academic performance, socio-economic background, technical skills, extracurricular participation, and expected salary. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can support better academic planning and career guidance for students.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze how academic performance (CGPA) influences expected salary

Study the impact of socio-economic factors such as family income and city

Examine the role of technical skills (Python experience) and leadership skills

Provide data-driven insights to support student career planning and institutional decision-making

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains student-level information including:

Personal and academic details

College and city information

CGPA and year of graduation

Family income

Python programming experience

Leadership skills

Event participation and expected salary

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization

Microsoft Excel – Dataset review and validation

Microsoft Word – Documentation of insights and findings

🔄 Data Preparation & Cleaning

Capitalized text values for consistency

Removed null, blank, and duplicate records

Split and standardized categorical fields

Created derived columns such as:

Family Income in LPA

CGPA ranges for analysis

Trimmed unnecessary white spaces

📈 Data Analysis & Visualizations

To answer the Basic and Moderate questions, the following Power BI visuals were used:

Cards

Tables

Pie and Donut Charts

Scatter Plots

Line and Trend Charts

Filters and slicers were applied, especially using the Designation column, to focus analysis only on student categories such as B.Sc IT, BE, B.Tech, MTech, MBA, MCA, etc.

🔍 Key Insights

Expected salary increases with higher CGPA and Python experience

Family income influences salary expectations, peaking at mid-income levels

Leadership skills positively impact salary expectations even at moderate CGPA levels

Python experience significantly boosts salary expectations for students with high CGPA
